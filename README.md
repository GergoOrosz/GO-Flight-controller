GO Flight flybarless and quadcopter controller is an open-source Arduino based project,
which aims to provide an open-source, cheap (in components) and easy to use platform for R/C aviation.
Its unique dual-controller design allows to run a full featured R/C controller on the small Arduino boards with 32kb memory.
